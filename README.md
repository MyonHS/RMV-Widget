# RMV-Widget

**This is a WIP**

This will become an RMV-Widget that is easy and quick to use. I will add features gradually whenever i have time. It's also there for me to learn how to work with APIs

You need to register for an API key at https://opendata.rmv.de/site/anmeldeseite.html
After you got your API key create a file called "apikey.txt" and put it in there

Current features:
- Show all departures of a Station in the next hour
- Show all arrivals of a Station in the next hour

Current Todo/Planned features:
- Choose a time value for Departure/Arrivalboard (default is 1 hour)
- Favorite Stations/Routes
- Show me all possible ways to travel from A to B, how long it takes and when i need to go
